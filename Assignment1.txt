Assignment 1
Discussion
1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? 
In our assignment, first we have two types of clients which consists of new clients and returning client. As service layer, we need a login functionality and also signup/registration page and clients are required to fill out some basic information. 
(profile management - most likely will be the front end like a web portal where it reads from the database client table and writes if it is updating existing client or adding new clients). 
Our back-end application requires to calculate fuel price, show fuel price history, and fuel price prediction based on client information which reads from the database in client table and write to fuel data table.
Like mentioned, we need to collect and save the client information as well as fuel information in database layer. *Please see UML diagram of this design

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? 
Tentatively for database, we will be able to use MYSQL which is free and easy to use with ASP.net or C# using Visual Studio IDE and for creating our website using HTML with CSS are our initial choices with javascripts. 

3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? 

Participation Report
We had a meeting brainstorming about the whole assignment on Monday and we all agreed about
what technology we would probably use for each part. Then Ahmed created the shared PowerPoint
for assignment 1. Zahra wrote the first part which was all the answers to the questions in the assignment. 
(we came up beforehand). The architecture designed was group work. In this matter that Zahra started with some components,
EC and Ahmed added more components to the designs and some comments regarding each technology. In conclusion, 
the whole assignment came from our meeting and agreement regarding the total goals.

Also, GitHub (which is new to most of us) has been set-up by Zahra and we are starting to experiment and familiarize with its functionality for the project.
